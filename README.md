# cn-graphql-handson

This repository escalated quickly... :)

Here you can find all sourceodes for graphql back-end hands-on I have done in CN group. Master branch contains common shared code, used to bootstrap new env for specific hands-on. Each branch corresponds with one hands-on that has been done:

## cn-internal branch

First grahql hands-on for CN. This event was recorded and streamed. Aim was to create graphql back-end powered by Prisma ORM. Contains small presentation with description of the libraries.

## bratislava branch

Second hands-on done in Bratislava branch of CN. Event was open to public. Content of the hands-on was almost same as in first instance.

## zlin branch

This time without Prisma, but with more focus on splitting code to maintanable chunks and making clear separation of GraphQL interface and controler functions with business logic.
